# Role Playing Game - Python

A command-line based Python role-playing game to enhance and develop Python programming skills. Learning goals were to practise the object’s effective interactions with several other objects. Data flow and state management of the game was also well practised.

## Description

The role-playing game is about the player team battling and defeating the enemy teams. The player and the enemy team can consist of a maximum of 5 character players. Various types of characters with unique abilities are available. The game state consists of a map, shop and battle stage. The player can collect gold within the map to purchase inventory. The player can purchase weapons, armour and potions from the shop, and assign them to team players. Within the battle, the player can choose the team player’s stance, action and inventory. Once all the enemy teams have been defeated, the game is won and the game statistics will be published.
